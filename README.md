# Clinical-data-project
## Project purpose and scope
The purpose of this project is to build a model that predict death following heart failure given patient's various variables: demographic variables (age, sex), blood test variables, medical variables (smoking, diabetes) and time from heart failure. 
For this purpose, I built two types of models: a "traditional" statistical model by using a Logistic regression in the first part of the project, and a deep learning model (Neural networks) in its second part. 
## Repository content
This repository contains two files:
* clinical_data_project.ipynb - Jupyter notebook file with the code for this project.
* heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv - CSV file with the data for this project that is being read by the code above.
